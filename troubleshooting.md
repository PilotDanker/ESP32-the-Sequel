# üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting ‚Äì ESP32-the-Sequel

Things don‚Äôt always go smooth. If your robot isn‚Äôt moving, Webots is being dramatic, or your ESP32 is silent ‚Äî this file is here to help.

---

### ü§ñ The robot isn‚Äôt moving in Webots

- Make sure the controller in your `.wbt` file is set to `"the_sequel_bot"`.
- Confirm `the_sequel_bot.py` is inside the `/controllers/` folder.
- Start your ESP32 (`Dijkstra.py`) **before** pressing play in Webots.
- ESP32 and PC must be on the same WiFi network ‚Äî check the IP!

---

### üåê ‚ÄúConnection reset by peer‚Äù or no response?

- This means Webots tried to connect to the ESP32, but it failed.
- Double-check the IP address at the top of `the_sequel_bot.py`.
- Restart both Webots and the ESP32 ‚Äî works more often than it should.
- If the ESP32 crashed, re-upload the script or reboot it.

### üß† Robot is moving, but it‚Äôs not doing what it should

- Is it starting **on** the black line? It has to.
- The grid must be consistent:
  - `0` = black line (pathable)  
  - `1` = white area (obstacle)
- The robot will try to recover if it loses the line ‚Äî spinning is normal.
- Line sensors might need tuning ‚Äî check `LINE_THRESHOLD` in the code if needed.

### üñ•Ô∏è ESP32 doesn‚Äôt show up in Thonny

- Go to **Tools > Interpreter > MicroPython (ESP32)**
- Use a data USB cable (not just a charging cable).
- Try ‚ÄúStop/Restart backend‚Äù in Thonny if things freeze.
- If all else fails, unplug and plug it back in.

---

### üì° Webots isn‚Äôt getting commands from ESP32

- Make sure ESP32 is running and listening on port `8080`.
- Messages must end with `\n` ‚Äî already handled in code, but worth checking.
- Watch the Webots terminal ‚Äî you‚Äôll see `"ESP32 Command:"` when data is received.

### üóÇÔ∏è Important: Don‚Äôt Save the World While It‚Äôs Running

Webots might ask you to save the world while you‚Äôre editing controllers or running simulations.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt save it if the robot has already moved.**

Saving at that point can:
- Break the robot‚Äôs spawn position
- Lock in weird states
- Corrupt the `.wbt` file

**üí° Fix:**  
Keep a backup of your world file, like `RaFLite_backup.wbt`. If things break:
1. Delete the broken `RaFLite.wbt`
2. Copy the backup and rename it

> TL;DR ‚Äì **Don‚Äôt save the world unless you mean it.**

### üåê Setting Up WiFi and IP Address (ESP32 Side)

Before the ESP32 can communicate with Webots, you‚Äôll need to configure a few things.

1. **Your WiFi Name & Password**  
   In `Dijkstra.py` (ESP32), replace:

   ```python
   ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME"
   password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
   Finding the ESP32‚Äôs IP Address
After booting, the ESP32 prints its IP in the Thonny serial monitor:

2. Finding the ESP32‚Äôs IP Address
   After booting, the ESP32 prints its IP in the Thonny serial monitor:

    Connected to WiFi
    IP address: xxx.xxx.x.xxx

    Copy that IP into the_sequel_bot.py:
    ESP32_IP_ADDRESS = "192.168.0.112"
   
4. Changing the Port (Optional)
The default is 8080. You can change it in both files ‚Äî just make sure they match.

ESP32_PORT = 8080

If Webots can‚Äôt connect, 90% of the time it‚Äôs an IP or port mismatch.

üßπ Still broken?
Restart Webots and the ESP32

Check your network connection

Read the console output ‚Äî it usually tells you what‚Äôs wrong

Take a break. Seriously. It helps.

This guide is just here to keep your sanity intact.
The robot wants to work ‚Äî it just needs a little patience (and maybe a reboot).
